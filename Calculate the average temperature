# Sample list of daily temperatures in Celsius
temperatures = [22.5, 23.0, 21.8, 24.1, 22.2, 23.5, 21.9]

# Calculate the total of all temperatures
total_temp = sum(temperatures)

# Count the number of temperature readings
num_readings = len(temperatures)

# Calculate the average temperature
average_temp = total_temp / num_readings

# Output the result
print(f"The average temperature is {average_temp:.2f}Â°C")
